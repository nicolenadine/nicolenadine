# HELLO! I'm Nicole 

Five years ago I moved across the country from Ann Arbor, MI to San Jose California. 
This led me to my current adventure into the world of computer science.
I'm excited to be a part of an industry that is constantly changing with endless 
possibilities to learn and to create. If this document sparks your curiosity to 
connect I am open to new projects & collaborations.

# Background
While working in business development I noticed there is sometimes a disconnect between
stakeholder needs and product development on the engineering side. I thrive on connecting
my technical and analytical side with my desire to provide great experiences and outcomes for
the end users. I enjoy being able to work cross-functionally and develop a deep understanding 
of a problem from multiple sides. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school to
build my knowledge and skill set in the fields of data science and machine learning. 
I see this as an area that has tremendous potential to impact many peopleâ€™s lives and
provide meaningful and unique solutions to problems facing individual users and communities.



# Career Interests
There are a lot of things that get me excited and curious. As a current student the tech
world still feels full of possibility with numerous paths to follow. Here are some areas 
that excite me...

* Machine learning algorithms 
     * Linear and logistic regression 
     * Neural networks
     * NLP
* Data visualization techniques 
* Python programming
* Game development

# Passions

* I love to travel both within the US and abroad. It is a bucket list goal of mine to 
visit all of the US National Parks. 
* I am a huge animal lover. Over the summer I did Rover just so I could play with other people's pets
* I enjoy gaming of all kinds (videogames, board games, tabletop RPG)

During the pandemic, when schools at all levels went online, I noticed parents, teachers and students 
struggling to adapt to new ways of learning. The traditional classroom learning model has been slow to adapt
to advancements in learning scienceand technology. I am curious about exploring ways that technology can be used to 
create more customized learning experiences that meet the needs of a wider range of students. I'm excited to see 
a lot of great companies and non-profit organizations working on this issue. At some point I would love to work 
with others who are passionate about educational equity and get involved in related projects. 

# Current Projects

1. Working on an independent study in linear algebra and machine learning. 
   * Over the course of the current academic year I'm working in collaboration with my former 
   linear algebra instructor to develop supplemental cirruculum for his linear algebra class. 
   Many students who take linear algebra are computer science majors and have expressed an interest 
   in how linear algebra is applied in the field of computer science. Through my exploration of machine learning
   I have made a lot of connections between the concepts covered in my linear algebra class and its use in ML
   such as in data representation and dimmensionality reduction. My goal over this year is to create a bonus module
   for his class that will let interested students explore applications of concepts learned in class in the field of ML.

2. Participating in the research & service leadership symposium 2023
   * For this year's symposium I am working on an application that will help STEM students identify instructors
   that are the best match for their learning style and needs as well as provide both on and off campus resources for support.
   This is a project I'm passionate about because I believe there are students who have a lot to offer the tech world but who
   come up against barriers either socioeconomic or disability related. I think there are relativelly inexpensive solutions that
   can help students to feel more supported and increase their chances of making it to graduation. I look forward to presenting 
   my project at the symposium spring 2023

3. 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course on Udemy taught by Dr. Angela Yu
   * I've already taken the three course OOP sequence in c++ that Foothill offers. They also teach it in python but it is the exact 
   material and assignments which would be way to repetitive and not at all time efficient. However, as a data science student 
   interested in machine learning I know that python is the way. So, I'm doing a 3 month ultra learning project to get up to speed in 
   python.
