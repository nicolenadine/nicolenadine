# HELLO! I'm Nicole 

Eight years ago I moved across the country from Ann Arbor, MI to San Jose California. 
A few twists and turns in the road (including a pandemic) led me to my current adventure 
into the world of computer science. I'm excited to be a part of an industry that is constantly changing with endless 
possibilities to learn and to create. If this document sparks your curiosity to 
connect I am open to new projects & collaborations.

### Recent Updates

- *April 25, 2025 - Currently wrapping up my last semester at SJSU. I just finished my Senior Research Project where I experimented with
  techniques for Malware Classificaiton Training comparing various image segmentation approaches. Final website will be published and shared shortly.

# Background
While working in business development I noticed there is sometimes a disconnect between
stakeholder needs and product development on the engineering side. I thrive on connecting
my technical and analytical side with my desire to provide great experiences and outcomes for
the end users. I enjoy being able to work cross-functionally and develop a deep understanding 
of a problem from multiple sides. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school to
build my knowledge and skill set in the fields of data science and machine learning. 
I see this as an area that has tremendous potential to impact many peopleâ€™s lives and
provide meaningful and unique solutions to problems facing individual users and communities.


# Career 
There are a lot of things that get me excited and curious. As a current student the tech
world still feels full of possibility with numerous paths to follow. Here are some areas 
that excite me...

* Machine learning: CNNs, NLP
* Data visualization techniques 
* Python programming
* Game development

# Passions

* I love to travel both within the US and abroad. It is a bucket list goal of mine to 
visit all of the US National Parks. 
* I am a huge animal lover. One summer I signed up a caregiver on Rover just so I could play with other people's pets.
* I enjoy gaming of all kinds (videogames, board games, tabletop RPG)

During the pandemic, when schools at all levels went online, I noticed parents, teachers, and students 
struggling to adapt to new ways of learning. The traditional classroom learning model has been slow to adapt
to advancements in learning science and technology. I am curious about exploring ways that machine learning can be 
used to create more customized learning experiences that meet the needs of a wider range of students. I'm excited to see 
a lot of great companies and non-profit organizations working on technology-based solutions to promote education equity.

# Projects 

1. Check out my senior project on using image segmentation to improve computational efficiency
   in malware classification training [here](https://github.com/nicolenadine/SeniorProject) The most exciting part of this
   project for me was that I had no prior knowledge in the subject area and had to really challenge myself to quickly build
   foundational knowledge required to produce a viable project in 10 weeks.
   
1. I was accepted into the 2023-2024 cohort of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) where I was involved in a team
   doing research into using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChatGPT to create chatbots highly tuned to make use of
   proprietary business data
