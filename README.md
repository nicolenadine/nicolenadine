# Background
While working in business development I noticed there is sometimes a disconnect between
stakeholder needs and product development on the engineering side. I thrive on connecting
my technical and analytical side with my desire to provide great service and outcomes for
the end users. I enjoy being able to work cross-functionally and develop a deep understanding 
of a problem from multiple sides. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school to
build my knowledge and skill set in the fields of data science and machine learning. 
I see this as an area that has tremendous potential to impact many peopleâ€™s lives and
provide meaningful and unique solutions to problems facing individual users and communities.
