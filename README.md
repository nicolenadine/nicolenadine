# HELLO! I'm Nicole 

Five years ago I moved across the country from Ann Arbor, MI to San Jose California. 
This led me to my current adventure into the world of computer science.
I'm excited to be a part of an industry that is constantly changing with endless 
possibilities to learn and to create. If this document sparks your curiosity to 
connect I am open to new projects & collaborations.

### Recent Updates

- *September 15, 2023 At times over the past year I have felt more like a math major than a CS major.
  All that work paid off though because I have officially transferred to SJSU's Computer Science department
  where I'm studying Data Science.
  
  Finally getting all of the math and lower division requirements out of the way I'm excited to finally have the
  space in my schedule for building things again.

# Background
While working in business development I noticed there is sometimes a disconnect between
stakeholder needs and product development on the engineering side. I thrive on connecting
my technical and analytical side with my desire to provide great experiences and outcomes for
the end users. I enjoy being able to work cross-functionally and develop a deep understanding 
of a problem from multiple sides. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school to
build my knowledge and skill set in the fields of data science and machine learning. 
I see this as an area that has tremendous potential to impact many peopleâ€™s lives and
provide meaningful and unique solutions to problems facing individual users and communities.



# Career 
There are a lot of things that get me excited and curious. As a current student the tech
world still feels full of possibility with numerous paths to follow. Here are some areas 
that excite me...

* Machine learning algorithms 
     * Linear and logistic regression 
     * Neural networks
     * NLP
* Data visualization techniques 
* Python programming
* Game development

# Passions

* I love to travel both within the US and abroad. It is a bucket list goal of mine to 
visit all of the US National Parks. 
* I am a huge animal lover. Over the summer I did Rover just so I could play with other people's pets
* I enjoy gaming of all kinds (videogames, board games, tabletop RPG)

During the pandemic, when schools at all levels went online, I noticed parents, teachers, and students 
struggling to adapt to new ways of learning. The traditional classroom learning model has been slow to adapt
to advancements in learning science and technology. I am curious about exploring ways that machine learning can be 
used to create more customized learning experiences that meet the needs of a wider range of students. I'm excited to see 
a lot of great companies and non-profit organizations working on technology-based solutions to promote education equity.

# Projects 

1. I was accepted into the 2023-2024 cohort of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) where I will be
   applying my computer and data science skills in two cross-disciplinary research projects.
2. I was also accepted into the 2023-2024 cohort of Project Engineering Success where I will be working with Faculty in
   the Chemical Engineering Department on research in computational neuroscience.
