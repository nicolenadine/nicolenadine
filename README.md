# HELLO! I'm Nicole 

Five years ago I moved across the country from Ann Arbor, MI to San Jose California. 
This led me to my current adventure into the world of computer science.
I'm excited to be a part of an industry that is constantly changing with endless 
possibilities to learn and to create. If this document sparks your curiosity to 
connect I am open to new projects & collaborations.

# Background
While working in business development I noticed there is sometimes a disconnect between
stakeholder needs and product development on the engineering side. I thrive on connecting
my technical and analytical side with my desire to provide great experiences and outcomes for
the end users. I enjoy being able to work cross-functionally and develop a deep understanding 
of a problem from multiple sides. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school to
build my knowledge and skill set in the fields of data science and machine learning. 
I see this as an area that has tremendous potential to impact many people’s lives and
provide meaningful and unique solutions to problems facing individual users and communities.



# Career Interests
There are a lot of things that get me excited and curious. As a current student the tech
world still feels full of possibility with numerous paths to follow. Here are some areas 
that excite me...

* Machine learning algorithms 
     * Linear and logistic regression 
     * Neural networks
     * NLP
* Data visualization techniques 
* Python programming
* Game development

# Passions

*I love to travel both within the US and abroad. It is a bucket list goal of mine to 
visit all of the US National Parks. 
*I am a huge animal lover. Over the summer I did Rover just so I could play with other people's pets
*I enjoy gaming of all kinds (videogames, board games, tabletop RPG)

During the pandemic, when schools at all levels went online, I noticed parents, teachers and students 
struggling to adapt to new ways of learning. It saddens me that the recent advancements in learning science
and technology are taking so long to be adapted into more customized learning experiences. However, I do see 
a lot of great companies and non-profit organizations working on this issue and it fills me with hope and excitement.
At some point I would love to work with others who are passionate about educational equity and how technology can
be used to better serve learners wherever they are in their journey.
