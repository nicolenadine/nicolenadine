# HELLO! I'm Nicole 

Five years ago I moved across the country from Ann Arbor, MI to San Jose California. 
This led me to my current adventure into the world of computer science.
I'm excited to be a part of an industry that is constantly changing with endless 
possibilities to learn and to create. If this document sparks your curiosity to 
connect I am open to new projects & collaborations.

# Background
While working in business development I noticed there is sometimes a disconnect between
stakeholder needs and product development on the engineering side. I thrive on connecting
my technical and analytical side with my desire to provide great experiences and outcomes for
the end users. I enjoy being able to work cross-functionally and develop a deep understanding 
of a problem from multiple sides. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school to
build my knowledge and skill set in the fields of data science and machine learning. 
I see this as an area that has tremendous potential to impact many people’s lives and
provide meaningful and unique solutions to problems facing individual users and communities.


#Career Interests
There are a lot of things that get me excited and curious. As a current student the tech
world still feels full of possibility with numerous paths to follow. Here are some areas 
that excite me...

1. Machine learning algorithms 
  * Linear and logistic regression 
  * Neural networks
  * NLP
2. Data visualization techniques 
3. Python programming
4. Game development 




During the pandemic,
when schools at all levels went online, I noticed parents and students struggling to adapt to
new ways of learning. I believe this really highlighted a problem that has existed in education for
